# Pricing Strategy Optimizer
 
#  Overview
The **Pricing Strategy Optimizer** is an AI-powered agent designed to analyze, predict, and optimize pricing strategies for businesses. It leverages **data analytics, machine learning, and competitor analysis** to provide actionable insights for setting the most effective prices.

#  Why Use This?
Effective pricing is crucial for maximizing revenue and staying competitive. This AI agent helps businesses:
- Analyze market trends and competitor pricing.
- Predict the optimal pricing strategy.
- Remove outliers and clean pricing data.
- Suggest psychological pricing points.
- Optimize pricing based on statistical and ML-driven insights.

# ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data cleaning and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning models for price prediction.
- **Streamlit** â€“ Interactive UI for visualization and model training.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization.
- **FastAPI (Optional)** â€“ For backend API exposure.

#  Strategies Implemented
1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Extracting numerical price values from raw data.
   - Standardizing prices for better comparisons.

2. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Computing min, max, mean, median, and standard deviation.
   - Grouping competitor pricing for market comparison.

3. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - Training regression models to predict optimal pricing.
   - Evaluating model performance using RÂ² scores.

4. **Psychological Pricing**  
   - Setting pricing just below round numbers (e.g., $99.99 instead of $100.00).
   - Adjusting prices based on demand elasticity.

5. **Competitor-Based Optimization**  
   - Monitoring market trends and adjusting dynamically.
